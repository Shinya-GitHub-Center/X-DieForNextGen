# Japan Charlemagne
I am an ordinary Japanese person who is trying to let people know what's happening in Japan.  
This country has seriously been sinking into a deep sea for around 30 to 35 years.  
People became totally apathy (an absence of emotion or enthusiasm),  
and the cities across the country are filled with an atmosphere of no way out....  
This downer mood has been accelerated especially in these 8 to 10 years.  
I guess this country would never come back to the Japanese peak era 1980's or even to the ordinary times...  
So please study about JAPANIFICATION (downside would come after prosperity) together and,  
let your friends know about this sad story, so that the future generations can skip this tragedy.  
We do not want to be like Charlemagne, the Holy Roman Emperor, again!! (and of course Japan again)
